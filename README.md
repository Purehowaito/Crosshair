基于C++开发的Windows桌面应用程序，通过创建透明的顶层窗口在屏幕上绘制准心，以帮助您在游戏中进行视觉定位。

程序不涉及进程注入、内存修改或系统驱动安装，因此游戏在以独占全屏下运行时可能会被覆盖；使用时您需遵循游戏运营方的用户协议及反作弊策略的允许下运行。

This is a Windows desktop application developed in C++ that renders a crosshair on the screen by creating a transparent top-level window, providing visual positioning assistance during gameplay.

The program does not involve process injection, memory modification, or the installation of system drivers. Due to the nature of window-based overlays, the crosshair may be obscured when a game is running in exclusive full-screen mode. Use of this software is subject to the game publisher’s user agreement and anti-cheat policies.
